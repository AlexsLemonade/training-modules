# Advanced scRNA-seq Training Module

This Childhood Cancer Data Lab-designed module covers more advanced topics in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.

The module builds on material in the [scRNA-seq  module](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/scRNA-seq), and analyses are designed to be performed within a [Docker container](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/docker-install) or on the Data Lab RStudio server.
It covers cell-type identification, integration of multiple single-cell RNA-seq libraries, and differential expression analyses, among other related topics.

The notebooks that comprise this module are:

* TBD


Additional exercise notebooks:
