# Advanced scRNA-seq Training Module

This Childhood Cancer Data Lab-designed module covers more advanced topics in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.

The module builds on material in the [scRNA-seq module](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/scRNA-seq), and analyses are designed to be performed within a [Docker container](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/Dockerfile) or on the Data Lab RStudio server.
It covers an overview of scRNA-seq processing, integration of multiple single-cell RNA-seq libraries, and differential expression analyses, among other related topics.

The notebooks that comprise this module are:

- [Introduction and review of processing scRNA-seq data](https://alexslemonade.github.io/training-modules/scRNA-seq-advanced/01-read_filter_normalize_scRNA.nb.html)
- [Integration of multiple scRNA-seq libraries](https://alexslemonade.github.io/training-modules/scRNA-seq-advanced/02-dataset_integration.nb.html)
- [Differential expression analysis](https://alexslemonade.github.io/training-modules/scRNA-seq-advanced/03-differential_expression.nb.html)

This directory also contains pathway analysis modules customized to these data:

- [Gene-set enrichment analysis](04-gene_set_enrichment_analysis.nb.html)
- [Pathway analysis with AUCell](05-aucell.nb.html)
