For now this directory should contain the following files downloaded from `ScPCA`:

- `SCPCL000478_filtered.rds`
- `SCPCL000479_filtered.rds`
- `SCPCL000480_filtered.rds`
- `SCPCL000481_filtered.rds`

In addition, it should contain a file `celltypes.tsv` which was compiled based on cell types annotated in [Patel et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2022.04.003).
This file has three columns representing SCPCA libraries, cell barcodes, and annotated cell types.
