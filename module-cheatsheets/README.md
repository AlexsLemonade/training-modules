### Cheatsheets Module

Cheatsheets are written in plain markdown and can be converted to a usable PDF format interactively:

+ Be on a MacOS computer
+ Install and/or open the [MacDown program](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
+ Open a md cheatsheet in MacDown, and go to `File` -> `Export` -> `PDF`
+ Save appropriately and voila!
