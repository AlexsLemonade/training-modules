# Using Data Lab Training Materials

[All Data Lab training materials](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master), including lecture slides, reference documents, instruction notebooks, and exercise notebooks are [openly licensed](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/LICENSE.md), modifiable, and freely available to download via GitHub. 
Data used during workshops is available via Amazon S3. 
Whether you are instructing in-person or virtually, you will need access to all of the materials that apply to your workshop topic and a server for hosting the materials. 

**All workshop participants must sign the Data Labâ€™s training waiver before participating in a workshop that uses our materials. 
[Participants can access and sign the waiver using this link](https://app.hellosign.com/s/2o2yghCj).**

## Data Lab RStudio Server

### How the Data Lab uses the RStudio Server

For both in-person and virtual workshops, we utilize [our RStudio server](https://rstudio.ccdatalab.org/auth-sign-in?appUri=%2F).
For each workshop, we set up accounts and home directories for participants and pre-install the tools (R packages, command line tools), data (raw and processed files), and notebook files that will be used during the workshop. 
Instructors can live code and walk participants through each notebook in real-time. 

Each participant will be able to log in to their account using their own web browser, which gives them full access to all pre-loaded materials. 
Once logged in, participants can code alongside instructors and complete their own copy of each exercise notebook.

The Data Lab will provide you with access to the server, set up accounts and home directories for your workshop, and create usernames and passwords for workshop participants. 
The Data Lab will allow training participants access to our RStudio server for 6 months after the workshop's conclusion.

### Using the Data Lab RStudio server for your workshop

**Training materials** 

**1.) If you plan to modify the training materials you are using, you must download our [`training-modules`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master) repository or [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on GitHub.** 
If you do not plan to make modifications, you can skip to step 3 and the Data Lab will upload the current version of the materials you are using to the RStudio server. 

Downloading or forking this repository will provide you with the materials for every Data Lab workshop. 
You can remove the files that are not relevant to the workshop you are teaching. 

* Download a ZIP of the repository 
* If you are familiar with GitHub and would prefer to create a remote copy of `training-modules`, you can also [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

**2.) After you have made changes, our team will need a copy of the modified material so we can add it to the server.** 

* If you downloaded a zip of the repository, send a zip file containing your version of the materials to `training@ccdatalab.org`. 
* If you forked the repository, please give the Data Lab full access to your remote copy of the repository.

**3.) The `training-modules` repository also contains the current version of the exercise notebooks that participants can use to practice what they learned during consultation periods and after the workshop.**

We will provide you with access to a repository that contains the answer key for the exercises. 
At the end of every workshop, download a zip file with the exercise notebook answers that apply to your workshop and distribute them to participants via email and Slack.

**RStudio**

**4.) You will provide a .csv file with training participant information so we can create usernames and passwords for them to access RStudio.**

* Please create two columns, one for `First name` and one for `Last name` and list all participant names. 
* Send this file to `training@ccdatalab.org` or post it on the admin Slack channel you have been added to. 
	
**5.) You will distribute individual RStudio credentials to each participant before your workshop begins and instruct them to log in and change their passwords.** 
[A set of instructions](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-specific-template/blob/main/virtual-setup/rstudio-login.md) to help participants get set up on the server can be found in our `training-specific-template` repo. 

**6.) Please inform participants that their server access will be revoked after 6 months.** 
We suggest taking note of this timeframe and planning to remind your participants when the time comes.

**7.) If participants plan to work with their own data during your workshop,** we have to ensure that it does not contain any personal health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII), before they can upload it to our RStudio server.
See the Participant pre-workshop set-up meetings section to learn more.

## Use your own infrastructure

If you are installing Data Lab training materials to your own server, follow these instructions for obtaining the files you need from GitHub and receiving data from Amazon S3. 

**1.) You must download our [`training-modules`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master) repository or fork the repository on GitHub** to obtain the training materials, make any modifications, and upload them to your own infrastructure.

**Please note**: Downloading the `training-modules` repo will provide you with the materials for every Data Lab workshop. You can remove the files that are not relevant to the workshop you are teaching and make any modifications you wish to the material.

**2.) Data that you need for the workshop lives on Amazon S3.**
The Data Lab will securely transfer the files to you ahead of the workshop. 
We will reach out to you with more information.

3.) Once you have all the necessary materials, packages, and data, you will install everything on your own server.
