## Instructor onboarding meeting

We strongly recommend that all external workshop instructors schedule an onboarding meeting with the Data Lab after their workshop has been confirmed. 
You will virtually meet with our team and ask any questions about our materials, getting set up, and instructing. 
If applicable, this is also a good time to get familiar with using our RStudio server, while we are there to help!  

[Please schedule a meeting using this link](https://meetings.hubspot.com/jen-omalley/external-workshop-onboarding-meeting). 
Remember, you can also reach out to us on [Slack](https://cancer-data-science.slack.com/) any time, and we will respond as soon as possible.

## Participant setup meetings

### Pre-workshop setup meetings

**Optional, but recommended: To help your workshop run smoothly, we suggest offering pre-workshop setup meetings** to make sure participants and their computers are prepared ahead of time. 
If you have the capacity, you can schedule brief individual meetings with participants. 
You can also consider holding open office hours during a video meeting or on Slack.

### Data pre-processing meetings

**Required in some cases: You may need to hold data pre-processing meetings for participants who plan to work with their own data.** 

We recommend offering these meetings when:

* Participants need help removing personal health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII) from their data.
* Participants are working with sequencing data from samples from human subjects.

Removing any PHI/PII is *always required* if you are using the Data Labâ€™s RStudio server. 
A [set of instructions](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-specific-template/blob/main/workshop/working-with-your-own-data.md) to help participants upload their own data and work with it on RStudio (after it has been de-identified) can be found in our `training-specific-template` repo.
