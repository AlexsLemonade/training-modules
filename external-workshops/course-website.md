# Creating a course website

We strongly recommend creating a course website for your workshop. 
Course websites ([example](https://alexslemonade.github.io/2023-june-training/)) are a centralized place for attendees to find information they need to participate in the workshop. 
At the Data Lab, we create a website for each course using our [`training-specific-template`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-specific-template) repository, which you may use as a template for your website.
You must create a GitHub account if you do not already have one. 

**1.)** First, create your own GitHub repository from `training-specific-template`, [using GitHub’s instructions for creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template). 

**2.)** Make sure you select your own GitHub account as the owner of the new repository and choose to make your repository public, so your participants will have access. 

**3.)** Once you have created the new repository, you can update the content for your own workshop and remove irrelevant files. Reference the Data Lab’s instructions for customizing this repository.

* Web content will vary depending on the topic, whether the workshop will be held in-person or virtually, among other factors. Some key information to consider including on your course website:
* Workshop description and structure
* A course schedule
* Overview of and instructors for installing the tools, materials, and software that will be used (ex. RStudio, Slack, video conferencing software) 
* Optional preparation materials (ex. Resources for getting familiar with R)
* Logistical information, such as the workshop location
