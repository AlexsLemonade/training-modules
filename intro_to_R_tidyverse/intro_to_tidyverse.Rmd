This Rmd is taking you through the basics of the tidyverse: a collection of packages
that make R use easier and more convenient.  

There are a lot of tutorials and free books Hadley Wickham and friends have on 
how to use the [tidyverse packages](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). 

R packages are collections of functions. But your R as it is will not have these
functions available unless you tell it to.  
```{r Load tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r }

```
