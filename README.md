# CCDL Training Modules

This repository is a collection of modules that are combined into 1-5 day workshops on computational topics for the childhood cancer research community.

**If you are childhood cancer researcher** and are interested attending a workshop go to the [CCDL's website](https://www.ccdatalab.org/projects-training)
to learn more about our upcoming workshop locations and dates.

You are also welcome to walk through this material on your own, either module
by module or by following a sample schedule [like that for the RNA-seq workshop](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/RNA-Seq-Exercises/blob/master/schedule.md).
The data files that we process in the course are too large to be stored on GitHub so you will not be able to follow the material *exactly* as written.

### Structure of each module:
