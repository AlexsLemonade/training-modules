# Check Participants' Set Up

## Zoom Preparation

If you have not yet activated Slack integration in Zoom, you will need to complete the following steps before checking a participant's set up:

- [Create a Zoom account](https://zoom.us/freesignup/).
- Type `/zoom` in a direct message with yourself, and authorize slack integration when prompted to do so.
- In the Zoom web app, you will then need to go to Settings -> Meeting to **enable** the `Join before host` option and **disable** the `Waiting room` option. 

## Slack

- DM the participant at the specified time in Cancer Data Science Slack.
This direct message should include:
 - RStudio Server credentials and the URL they will need to navigate to (`rstudio.ccdatalab.org`). 
 - An initiation for a Zoom call using `/zoom`.

## Zoom
 
- Ask the participant to join you in the the Zoom meeting (this tests the joining with computer audio set up).
- Ask the participant to share a portion of their screen that includes a browser window.

## RStudio Server

- Ask the participant to navigate to [rstudio.ccdatalab.org](https://rstudio.ccdatalab.org/) while they continue to share their screen and to use their credentials to log in.
- Prompt the participant to go to Terminal and change their password using the `passwd` command as in the [RStudio login instructions](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/virtual-setup/rstudio-login.md).
