## Setup for CCDL Virtual Workshops

The `virtual-setup` module houses instructions specifically for CCDL virtual training workshops.

A key feature of CCDL in-person workshops is built-in time designed for helping workshop participants work with their own data or data relevant to their research questions to practice skills taught during instruction.

We attempt to recreate this in a virtual workshop by splitting our time together into _instruction days_ and _consultation days_. 

During _instruction days_, we will go through hands-on notebooks prepared by CCDL staff together.
CCDL staff will be on-hand assist participants and answer questions in addition to the instructor leading the hands-on exercise.

During _consultation days_, CCDL staff will be available via Slack and Zoom to provide assistance and answer questions. 
Participants may be grouped together based on the task they choose to work on during consultation days.
