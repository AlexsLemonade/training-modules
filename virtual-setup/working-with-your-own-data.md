## Working with your own data

The goal of our workshop is to equip you to do initial analyses with your own data!
This guide will take you through how to get your data onto our RStudio server so you can begin analyzing your own data!

### Things to know before uploading your data:
- If you are uploading data from human patient sequencing samples, **please be sure that you are doing so in a manner that is consistent with participant consents and your institutionâ€™s rules**. The only human data that is permissible for upload to our server is non-identifiable and has been summarized to non-sequence level.

- Initially, we have equipped you with **50 GB of space** (if the data you would like to upload is larger than this, please consult one of the CCDL team members through Slack for assistance).

- If you don't have your own data that you are looking to analyze, but would like real transcriptomic datasets to practice with, see our recommended list here:
TODO: Add info about recommended datasets.

- As always, please Slack one of the CCDL team members if you need help (that is what we are here for!).

### Upload data that is online (from a url)

If you are retrieving your data from online, perhaps from a publicly available repository, we encourage you to use the terminal command `wget`.

**Step 1)** Go to the Terminal tab in your RStudio session.

![Terminal tab](screenshots/rstudio-session.png)

**Step 2)** Set up your `wget` command in a script (or notebook) using this template.

The most simple `wget` command just needs the URL to pull the file from.

*Template:*
```
wget <URL>
```

*Specific example:* Here's an example of us downloading a file from ArrayExpress
```
wget https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-GEOD-67851/E-GEOD-67851.processed.1.zip
```

By default, the file will be saved to the current directory and the file name it had from its origin (so with the above example `E-GEOD-67851.processed.1.zip`).

Likely you will want to be more specific about where you are saving the file to and what you are calling it.
For that, we can use the `-O`, or `output` option with our `wget` command and specify a file path.  

*Template:*
```
wget -O <FILE_PATH_TO_SAVE_TO> <URL>
```

*Specific example:* Here's an example where we will download that same array express file, but instead save it to the `data` folder and call it `some_array_data.zip`.
(Best to keep the file extension consistent to avoid troubles!)

```
wget -O data/some_array_data.zip https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-GEOD-67851/E-GEOD-67851.processed.1.zip
```

`-O` is one of many `wget` command options.
To see the complete list of `wget` options, use the command: `wget -h` in bash.

[See more `wget` examples](https://www.tecmint.com/10-wget-command-examples-in-linux/)

### Upload data from your own computer

If the data you want to use is stored locally on your computer, here's how we recommend uploading it to the RStudio Server.

**Step 1)** We recommend you compress your data folder into a single zip file.

For most operating systems, you can right-click on your data folder, and choose `Compress` to zip up your files
- [Windows zipping](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files)
- [Mac zipping](https://www.imore.com/how-compress-file-your-mac)

For reference, here's how you [compress files from the command line](https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/how-to-compress-and-uncompress-files-and-folders-in-os-x-lion-10-7-using-terminal/).

**Step 2)** Once your data is compressed to a single file, [navigate to your RStudio session](./rstudio-login.md).

**Step 3)** Use the `Upload button` to choose your compressed data folder.

This button is in the lower right panel of your RStudio session:
![Upload button](screenshots/upload-button.png)

A mini screen will pop up asking you to choose the file you want to upload:

![Choose file](screenshots/upload-choose-file.png)

Choose your compressed data file, and click `OK`.
This may take some time, particularly if you have a large dataset.  

When the server is finished uploading your data, you should see your file in your `home` directory!

### Reading the data into your R environment.

This step is very dependent on the format of your data and what you are planning to do with it!
If your file is a TSV, CSV, or RDS file, follow the examples in the [`intro-to-R-tidyverse/intro-to-tidyverse.Rmd` notebook](intro-to-R-tidyverse/03-intro_to_tidyverse.Rmd).

We do NOT recommend clicking on the file in the RStudio panel to load it into your R environment, this typically won't work for anything that's not a very small file.

Plus, for reproducibility purposes, you should write the data reading step into your notebook analyses!

## Downloading files

Any files on the RStudio server you would like to save to your computer you can export.

**Step 1)** We recommend you compress the files you want copied to your computer into a zip file.

For this, you can go to the `Terminal tab` and use the `zip` command (which is installed on the server).
To `zip` a file (you can use `zip -h` to see all the options), you need to provide at least two arguments.

- `<NAME_FOR_NEW_ZIP_FILE>` should end in `.zip` and its whatever you would like your new zip file to be called.
- `<FILE_TO_ZIP>` should be the file path to the file you'd like to `zip`
- `-r` if the `<FILE_TO_ZIP>` you specified is a folder of multiple files, you need to also put this in your command

*Template for single file*
```
zip <NAME_FOR_NEW_ZIP_FILE> <FILE_TO_ZIP>
```
*Template for folder of multiple files*
```
zip -r <NAME_FOR_NEW_ZIP_FILE> <FOLDER_TO_ZIP>
```

*Example 1:*
This first example is a single file, `results.tsv`, that is stored in the `results` folder.
(Notice we aren't using `-r` here for a single file).

```
zip results.zip results/results.tsv
```

*Example 2:*
This second example shows a folder, `results/`, that we would like to zip up all of its contents.  
Notice we are using `-r` now!

```
zip -r results.zip results/
```

**Step 2)** Use the Export button!

Click on the `More` button with a gear next to it in the lower right pane.

![Export button](screenshots/export-button.png)

**Step 3)** Specify the zipped file you'd like to download.

![Export window](![Export button](screenshots/export-window.png))

**Step 4)** Find where the file downloaded
You computer may show the file in the bottom left of your browser window.
You can are likely to find your zip file in your `Downloads` folder!
