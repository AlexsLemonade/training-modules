# scRNA-Seq Training Module

This CCDL-designed module covers the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data using [Salmon's Alevin](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) and [scater/scran](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/scran/inst/doc/scran.html) packages.

It depends on knowledge gained in the [Intro to R](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/intro-to-R-tidyverse) and analyses are performed within a [Docker container](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/docker-install) or on the CCDL Rstudio server.
It covers normalization and dimension reduction methods that can be used for both tag-based and full-length single-cell data, as well as the quantification of tag-based scRNA-seq data.

The notebooks that comprise this module are:
* [QC and filtering of single cell data](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/scRNA-seq/01-normalizing_scRNA-seq.nb.html)
* [Normalization using scater/scran](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/scRNA-seq/02-normalizing_scRNA-seq.nb.html)
* [Quantification of tag-based data](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/scRNA-seq/04-tag-based_scRNA-seq_processing.nb.html)
* [Dimension reduction](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/scRNA-seq/05-dimension_reduction_scRNA-seq.nb.html)
