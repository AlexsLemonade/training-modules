In this notebook, we'll import the gastric cancer data and do some exploratory
analyses and visual inspection.
We'll use the [`DESeq2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) package for this.

`DESeq2` also has an 
[excellent vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) 
from Love, Anders, and Huber from which this is adapted 
(see also: [Love, Anders, and Huber. _Genome Biology_. 2014.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8)).

## Libraries and functions

```{r}
# Load the DESeq2 library

```

```{r}
# magrittr pipe
`%>%` <- dplyr::`%>%`
```

## Directories and files

```{r}
# directory with the tximport processed data
txi_dir <- file.path("data", "tximport", "gastric_cancer")
txi_file <- file.path(txi_dir, "gastric_cancer_tximport.RDS")
```

We'll create a directory to hold our plots.

```{r}
# Create a plots directory if it does not exist yet

```

```{r}
# sample metadata file
meta_dir <- file.path("data", "sample_metadata")
meta_file <- file.path(meta_dir, "gastric_cancer",
                       "gastric_cancer_sample_metadata.tsv")
```

**Output**

```{r}
# We will save a PDF copy of the PCA plot to the plots directory
# and name the file "gastric_cancer_PC_scatter.pdf"

```

## DESeq2

### Creating a DESeq2 dataset from tximport object

First, let's read in the data we processed with `tximport`.

```{r}
# Read in the RDS file we created in the last notebook

```

```{r}
# Let's look at the first few rows of the gene-level counts
 
```

```{r}
# Let's look at the first few rows of the gene-level TPM

```

And now we'll read in the sample metadata.

```{r}
# Read in the sample metadata TSV file and have a look

```

```{r}
colnames(txi$counts)
```

We'll reorder the sample metadata to match the order in `txi`

```{r}
sample_meta_df <- sample_meta_df %>%
  dplyr::arrange(accession)
sample_meta_df
```

```{r}
all.equal(colnames(txi$counts), sample_meta_df$accession)
```

We use the tissue of origin in the design formula because that will allow us
to model this variable of interest.

```{r}
ddset <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                  colData = sample_meta_df,
                                  design = ~ tissue)
```

### Variance stabilizing transformation

Before visualizing the data, we'll transform it such that it is on a `log2` 
scale for large counts and library size is taken into account with the `DESeq2` 
function for variance stabilizing transformation.
See [this section of
the `DESeq2` vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#data-transformations-and-visualization) 
for more on this topic. 

```{r}
vst_data <- vst(ddset)
```

### Principal components analysis

Principal components analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique
that captures the main sources of variation in our data in the first two 
principal components (PC1 and PC2).
Visualizing PC1 and PC2 can give us insight into how different variables (e.g.,
tissue source) affect our dataset and help us spot any technical effects 
(more on that below).

`DESeq2` has built-in functionality for performing PCA.

```{r}
# DESeq2 built in function is called plotPCA and we want to color points by
# tissue

```

Save the most recent plot to file with `ggsave` from `ggplot2`

```{r}
# Save the PDF file 
ggplot2::ggsave(pca_plot_file, plot = ggplot2::last_plot())
```

## A note on technical effects

We don't have batch information (i.e., when the samples were run) for this 
particular experiment, but let's imagine that `SRR585574` and `SRR585576` were
run separately from all other samples.
We'll put this in new "toy" column in `sample_meta_df`.

```{r}
sample_meta_df$batch <- c("batch1", "batch1", "batch1", "batch1", "batch2", 
                          "batch1", "batch2", "batch1")
```

Let's rerun the `DESeq2` steps.

```{r}
# Rerun the dataset creation step
# Note: if we were using this for differential expression AND we truly knew
# the batch, we'd likely use design = ~ batch + tissue


# variance stabilizing transformation

```

```{r}
# PCA plot - tissue *and* batch
# We want plotPCA to return the data so we can have more control about the plot


# Here we are setting up the percent variance that we are extracting from the `pca_data` object
percent_var <- round(100 * attr(pca_data, "percentVar"))
```

Let's use ggplot to vizualize the first two principal components. 

```{r}
# Color points by "batch" and use shape to indicate the tissue of origin

```

## Session Info

Record session info for reproducibility & provenence purposes.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
