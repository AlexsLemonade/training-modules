# Machine Learning Training Module

This CCDL-designed module analyzes pediatric brain tumor data from the [OpenPBTA project](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis) using some machine learning methods.
OpenPBTA contains data from [Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium](https://cbttc.org/) and the PNOC003 DIPG clinical trial from the [Pediatric Pacific Neuro-oncology Consortium](http://www.pnoc.us/).

This material depends on knowledge gained in the [Intro to R](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/tree/master/intro-to-R-tidyverse) module and analyses can be performed within a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/ccdl/training_rnaseq).
It covers how to make heatmaps, perform consensus clustering, and obtain correlated patterns of expression in data or latent variables (LVs) through the implementation of PLIER (Pathway-Level Information Extractor).

The notebooks that comprise this module are (estimated time to complete notebook):

* [Heatmap](https://alexslemonade.github.io/training-modules/machine-learning/01-openpbta_heatmap.nb.html) (1 hr)
* [Clustering](https://alexslemonade.github.io/training-modules/machine-learning/02-openpbta_consensus_clustering.nb.html) (55 minutes)
* [PLIER](https://alexslemonade.github.io/training-modules/machine-learning/03-openpbta_PLIER.nb.html) (30 minutes)
* [Group differences in latent variable (LV) expression](https://alexslemonade.github.io/training-modules/machine-learning/04-openpbta_plot_LV.nb.html) (30 minutes)
* [Additional exercises](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/machine-learning/05-machine_learning_exercise.Rmd)

_Total estimated time to complete instruction notebooks: 2 hours 55 minutes_
